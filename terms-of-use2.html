* 
Single Account per Member/Agency: Each individual member or real estate agency may register only one (1) account on the Website. Account access rights are strictly personal and non-transferable. Any individual or agency found to have registered more than one (1) account shall have all additional accounts immediately suspended without prior notice. All accumulated "House Coins" within such duplicate accounts shall be forfeited and not refunded under any circumstances. Furthermore, the Website reserves the right to charge applicable service fees for services used, as well as administrative penalties for damages caused by duplicate registrations.

* 
Real Estate Agent Disclosure Requirement: Applicants who are licensed real estate agents must provide complete and accurate agent information at the time of registration. If the Website discovers that such information has been omitted or misrepresented, it reserves the right to suspend all posting and commenting privileges immediately, and require the applicant to rectify the missing or incorrect details before reinstatement.

* 
User Responsibility for Posted Content: The Website provides a platform for browsing and searching listings. Website personnel are responsible solely for managing the Website and content they themselves post, including data and files. All content, data, and files uploaded, posted, or otherwise disseminated by members are the sole responsibility of the respective member. Members are required to comply not only with the Website's rules but also with all applicable laws and regulations of Hong Kong, including but not limited to the Contracts Ordinance, Electronic Transactions Ordinance, and Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.

* 
No Warranty of Accuracy: The Website does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content posted by users, except for content directly authored or published by Website staff. Users are advised to exercise independent judgment when accessing or relying upon such content. The Website expressly disclaims all liability for any loss, damage, or harm arising from reliance on user-generated content.

* 
Indemnification for Infringement: Any content posted by a member that infringes upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other legal rights of a third party shall be the sole responsibility of the member who posted it. The Website shall not be held liable for any claims, damages, or expenses arising from such infringement.

* 
Prohibited Content: No user shall upload, post, transmit, distribute, or otherwise make available any content via the Website that is illegal, unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, obscene, indecent, vulgar, discriminatory, racist, sexist, offensive, or otherwise objectionable in moral or social terms. This includes but is not limited to content that promotes hate, violence, or discrimination.

*

* 
Prohibition of External Links: It is strictly forbidden to post, embed, or direct links—whether directly or indirectly—to any third-party property listing websites or platforms from within the Website. Violation of this rule may be treated as a serious breach of conduct, resulting in immediate suspension or permanent banning of the user’s account. Any prepaid "House Coins" shall not be refunded under any circumstances.

* 
Website Discretion on Content Management: The Website reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to delete, modify, relocate, or remove any content, data, or files posted by users, without prior notice or compensation. Such actions shall not constitute grounds for claim or refund.

* 
Enforcement Authority: Website personnel hold full authority to determine whether a member has violated these Terms, assess the severity of any violation, and impose appropriate sanctions. This includes disciplinary action against any behavior not explicitly covered herein that disrupts or interferes with the normal operation of the Website.

* 
Abuse of Ranking System: If a member is found to exploit technical vulnerabilities or use unauthorized methods to manipulate the ranking order of property listings, the Website reserves the right to suspend or terminate the member’s account immediately. Any prepaid "House Coins" shall be forfeited and not refunded.

* 
Amendments to Terms: The Website may amend, add to, or delete any part of these Terms at any time without prior notification. Members are responsible for periodically reviewing the Terms of Use page to stay informed of any changes.</pre>
